# React useEffect Cleanup Function Issue

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug where the cleanup function within a React `useEffect` hook might not always execute when a component is unmounted quickly.  This can lead to memory leaks or other unexpected behavior.

## Problem

The `useEffect` hook's cleanup function is crucial for releasing resources or canceling asynchronous operations when a component unmounts.  However, if the component unmounts before the cleanup function has a chance to run (e.g., due to rapid state changes or navigation), the cleanup logic is skipped.

## Solution

This repository provides a solution that mitigates this problem by employing a more robust approach to managing the cleanup process. The solution ensures that the cleanup function is always executed whenever the component is unmounted. This is especially important when dealing with timers, subscriptions, or other resources that need proper cleanup to prevent unintended consequences.
